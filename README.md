2. **Testing**

```javascript
// AI-assisted test case generation
describe('Capacity Calculation', () => {
  test('handles empty assignments', () => {
    expect(calculateCapacity([])).toBe(0);
  });
  
  test('correctly sums allocation percentages', () => {
    const assignments = [
      { allocationPercentage: 30 },
      { allocationPercentage: 70 }
    ];
    expect(calculateCapacity(assignments)).toBe(100);
  });
});
```
